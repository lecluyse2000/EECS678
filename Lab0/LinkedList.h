/* 
 * Linked List Node Definition:
 * In C, structs serve a similar purpose to classes in other languages like Python,
 * but without methods or inheritance. Structs are user-defined data types that
 * allow you to combine primary data types of different kinds.
 * 
 * Structs are particularly useful when you need to group data that belongs together,
 * making the code more modular and understandable. For example, a linked list node
 * contains data and a pointer to the next node, forming a chain.
 * 
 * Here's how you define a struct for a linked list node:
 * - `int data`: holds the integer data for this node.
 * - `struct Node* next`: is a pointer to the next node in the list, or NULL if there is no next node.
 * 
 * This structure is fundamental in creating linked lists in languages like C where
 * high-level abstractions such as Python's list class are not built-in.

/*
 * Function: createNode
 * Description: Creates a new node for a linked list containing integer data and a pointer to the next node.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   data - The integer data to store in the node.
 *
 * Return:
 *   A pointer to the newly created node of type 'struct Node'.
 *
 * Note:
 *   - Use 'malloc' to allocate memory for the new node.
 *   - Ensure to define the type of each variable and the function return value.

 *
 * Return:
