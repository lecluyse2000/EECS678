### Objective


#### Learn Linked List Implementation

You practice implementing core operations on linked lists, such as node creation, insertion, traversal, and deletion. This helps build your understanding of memory management (dynamic memory allocation and deallocation), pointers, and struct usage in C.

#### Solve Real-World Problems

By solving problems such as detecting cycles in linked lists and merging two sorted lists, you apply your understanding of algorithms and data structures to real-world scenarios. These problems introduce concepts like fast/slow pointer techniques (cycle detection) and algorithmic merging (sorting and combining data structures).
